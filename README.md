In this brief project, I implemented a new hybrid model to analyze the jores21 dataset from ML4GLand/tutorials. The new model was adapted from the Hybrid.yaml model found on the ML4GLand/tutorials page. The goal of this project was to familiarize myself with hybrid models and see how changing around model parameters affected the outcome of the dataset analysis.
